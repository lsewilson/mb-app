This repo contains a recreation of the 'Book a Viewing' feature on the Movebubble app and has been created using React.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
  * Git
  * NPM
  * Google Chrome

### Set up

Install all dependencies listed in the package.json file:

## Running the app

### Running tests

Mocha, Chai and Enzyme were used for testing.
```

```

### Viewing in a browser

This app is mobile-responsive. Start by running the program.

This should open a new browser window for the address http://localhost:3000. If not, visit this address manually.

Open up Dev Tools on the browser. In Google Chrome, this can be done through the tool bar:

View > Developer > Developer Tools

Click 'Toggle device toolbar' in the top left corner of the window to change to a mobile view.
